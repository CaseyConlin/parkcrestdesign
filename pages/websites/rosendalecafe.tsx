Their new website provided an updated look with mobile-responsive pages relevant to the restaurant and an integrated calendar to highlight their many music events and community gatherings that took place at the restaurant. The migration of the site included moving more than 1,500 events to a new server to preserve the pageâ€™s existing strong SEO and historical significance. Calendar events were integrated with MailChimp newsletter feeds to provide weekly marketing emails of featured events."
